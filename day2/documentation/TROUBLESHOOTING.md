# Troubleshooting Guide

If you encounter issues during the Day 2 labs, start here:

- See the course FAQ: ../../resources/faq.qmd
- GEE Community Forum: https://groups.google.com/g/google-earth-engine-developers
- Instructor support during lab hours

Common steps:
- Reduce AOI size and window sizes for GLCM
- Lower cloud thresholds if no imagery found
- Export intermediate results to avoid timeouts
- Re-authenticate Google Earth Engine if needed
