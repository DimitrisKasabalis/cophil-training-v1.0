# Day 1: EO Data & AI/ML Fundamentals

### Earth Observation Data, AI/ML Fundamentals & Geospatial Python

Building the essential skills for AI-powered satellite data analysis
:::

## Day 1 Overview

Welcome to Day 1 of the **CoPhil EO AI/ML Training Programme**! Today you'll build a solid foundation in Earth Observation data and AI/ML fundamentals. By the end of the day, you'll understand Copernicus missions, Philippine EO resources, and be ready to start building AI models.

::: {.callout-note}
## What You'll Learn Today

This day provides the foundation for your AI/ML journey in Earth Observation. You'll gain both theoretical understanding and hands-on experience with the tools and data that power modern EO applications.
:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 1, you will be able to:

::: {.learning-objectives}
- **Identify** the characteristics and applications of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions
- **Navigate** Philippine EO platforms including PhilSA SIYASAT, NAMRIA Geoportal, and DOST-ASTI tools
- **Explain** the AI/ML workflow for Earth Observation applications
- **Distinguish** between supervised and unsupervised learning with EO examples
- **Understand** neural network fundamentals and data-centric AI principles
- **Load and visualize** vector data using GeoPandas
- **Read and process** raster imagery using Rasterio
- **Query and filter** satellite imagery collections in Google Earth Engine
- **Apply** cloud masking and create temporal composites
- **Export** processed EO data for AI/ML workflows

## Prerequisites

::: {.prerequisites}
### What You Need

**Before starting Day 1:**

- [ ] Complete [setup guide](../resources/setup.qmd)
- [ ] Google account (for Colab and Earth Engine)
- [ ] Google Earth Engine account (sign up at [earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com))
- [ ] Basic Python knowledge (variables, loops, functions)
- [ ] Familiarity with remote sensing concepts (helpful but not required)

**Technical Setup:**

All exercises run in Google Colaboratory - no local installation required! See our [Setup Guide](../resources/setup.qmd) for detailed instructions.
:::

## Hands-on Notebooks

::: {.callout-tip}
## Interactive Learning

Day 1 includes two comprehensive Jupyter notebooks that you'll work through during Sessions 3 and 4:

- **[Notebook 1: Python for Geospatial Data](notebooks/notebook1.qmd)** - GeoPandas and Rasterio exercises
- **[Notebook 2: Google Earth Engine](notebooks/notebook2.qmd)** - GEE filtering, compositing, and export

Both notebooks run in Google Colab with all dependencies pre-configured.
:::

## 2025 Updates Highlighted

This training incorporates the latest 2025 developments in Earth Observation and AI:

- **Sentinel-2C operational** (January 2025) - Three-satellite constellation with 5-day revisit
- **Sentinel-1C active** - Restored dual-satellite SAR coverage
- **Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem** - New data access platform with SentiBoard dashboard
- **PhilSA SIYASAT portal** - Secure data archive for NovaSAR-1 and maritime monitoring
