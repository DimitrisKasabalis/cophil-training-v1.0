## Part 1: The Copernicus Programme

### What is Copernicus?

**Copernicus** is the European Union's flagship Earth Observation programme providing **free and open satellite data** for environmental monitoring and societal applications worldwide. It represents the world's largest single Earth observation programme, with a multi-billion euro investment.

::: {.callout-note}
## Why "Copernicus"?

Named after Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), the Renaissance astronomer who formulated the heliocentric model of the universe. Just as Copernicus revolutionized our understanding of our place in the cosmos, the Copernicus programme transforms our understanding of Earth systems.
:::

## Part 2: Sentinel-1 - Synthetic Aperture Radar

### Mission Overview

::: {.satellite-badge}
Sentinel-1A (2014)
:::
::: {.satellite-badge}
Sentinel-1B (2016-2022)
:::
::: {.satellite-badge}
Sentinel-1C (Dec 2024)
:::

**Sentinel-1** is a **C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** mission providing all-weather, day-and-night imaging capability.

### 2024-2025 Constellation Updates

- **Sentinel-1A:** Operational since April 2014, continuing strong performance
- **Sentinel-1B:** Operational 2016-2022 (anomaly ended operations December 23, 2021)
- **Sentinel-1C:** **Successfully launched December 5, 2024** aboard Vega-C rocket
  - Currently in commissioning phase
  - Will restore dual-satellite constellation with 1A
  - **Improved AIS (Automatic Identification System)** for enhanced vessel tracking
- **Sentinel-1D:** Scheduled for launch **November 4, 2025**

::: {.callout-tip}
## Why SAR Matters for the Philippines

The Philippines experiences:

- Frequent cloud cover (tropical climate)
- Monsoon seasons with persistent rain
- Nighttime disasters (earthquakes, floods)
- ~20 typhoons annually

**SAR sees through clouds and operates at night** - critical for disaster response when optical satellites are blinded. The restored two-satellite constellation will provide **6-day revisit time** over the Philippines, enhancing rapid response capabilities.

- **Application:** Wave height and direction, maritime safety

**For Philippine land applications:** IW mode is standard.

### Understanding Polarization

SAR polarization refers to the orientation of the radar wave's electric field. Different surface types respond differently to different polarizations:

**VV (Vertical-Vertical):**
- Transmit and receive in vertical polarization
- Sensitive to surface roughness
- **Best for:** Ocean monitoring, flood detection, bare soil

**VH (Vertical-Horizontal) - Cross-Polarization:**
- Transmit vertical, receive horizontal
- Sensitive to volume scattering
- **Best for:** Forest biomass, vegetation structure, crop classification

**HH (Horizontal-Horizontal):**
- Transmit and receive in horizontal polarization
- Sensitive to surface scattering
- **Best for:** Sea ice classification, soil moisture

**HV (Horizontal-Vertical) - Cross-Polarization:**
- Transmit horizontal, receive vertical
- Volume scattering sensitivity
- **Best for:** Vegetation monitoring

#### Backscatter Characteristics by Target Type

- **Water (calm):** Very low backscatter (specular reflection) → **very dark**
- **Water (rough/waves):** Low to moderate backscatter → **dark to medium gray**
- **Bare soil:** Moderate backscatter → **medium gray**
- **Vegetation:** Moderate to high backscatter (volume scattering) → **medium to light gray**
- **Urban/buildings:** Very high backscatter (double-bounce) → **very bright**
- **Flooded vegetation:** Very high backscatter (double-bounce from water-plant) → **bright**

### Data Products

#### Level-1 Single Look Complex (SLC)
- **Type:** Complex (amplitude + phase)
- **Geometry:** Slant range
- **Use Cases:**
  - **InSAR (Interferometry)** for ground deformation
  - Coherence analysis
  - Advanced polarimetric analysis
- **Applications:** Earthquake monitoring, volcanic deformation, landslide detection, subsidence

#### Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD)
- **Type:** Detected, multi-looked intensity
- **Geometry:** Ground range projected (WGS84 ellipsoid)
- **Processing:** Focused, detected, multi-looked, projected
- **Values:** Amplitude only (no phase information)
- **Pixel Spacing:** 10 m (IW, SM), 40 m (EW)
- **Most common for:** Change detection, flood mapping, land cover classification

#### Level-2 Ocean (OCN)
- **Type:** Geophysical ocean products
- **Parameters:** Wind fields, wave spectra, surface radial velocity
- **Format:** NetCDF
- **Applications:** Maritime safety, weather forecasting

::: {.callout-note}
## GRD vs SLC - When to Use Each

**Use GRD when:**
- Detecting changes in backscatter intensity
- Mapping floods or water bodies
- Classifying land cover
- Working with single-date images
- You need simpler, faster processing

**Use SLC when:**
- Measuring ground deformation with InSAR
- Calculating coherence between image pairs
- Performing polarimetric analysis
- You need phase information
- Precision measurements are critical
:::

### Sentinel-1 Applications

**Disaster Risk Reduction:**
- **Flood extent mapping** - Water appears dark due to specular reflection
- **Earthquake damage assessment** - Coherence change detection
- **Landslide detection** - Temporal change analysis
- **Volcanic deformation** - InSAR millimeter-level precision

**Natural Resource Management:**
- **Deforestation monitoring** - All-weather forest change detection
- **Rice paddy mapping** - Temporal backscatter analysis
- **Mangrove extent** - Coastal wetland monitoring
- **Soil moisture** - Agricultural water management

**Maritime Applications:**
- **Ship detection and tracking** (enhanced with Sentinel-1C/1D AIS)
- **Oil spill monitoring** - Dampening of Bragg scattering
- **Sea ice classification** - Ice type and concentration
- **Illegal fishing detection**

### Five Powerful Sentinel-1 Use Cases (2024 ESA Report)

According to the Copernicus OBSERVER 2024 report, these are the five key applications leveraging Sentinel-1C:

1. **Arctic Sea Ice Monitoring** - All-season navigation route planning
2. **Land Subsidence Detection** - InSAR with millimeter-level precision for urban areas
3. **Agricultural Land Use** - Crop type classification using temporal backscatter signatures
4. **Oil Spill Detection** - Rapid response for maritime pollution incidents
5. **Forest Structure Mapping** - Canopy height and biomass assessment

### Example: Sentinel-1 Flood Mapping

SAR backscatter characteristics during flooding:

- **Pre-flood agricultural land:** Moderate backscatter (vegetation) → **medium gray**
- **During flood:** Low backscatter (water surface) → **dark**
- **Flooded urban areas:** Very high backscatter (double-bounce) → **bright**

::: {.callout-tip}
## Flood Mapping Best Practice

**VV polarization** shows dark water (low backscatter from smooth surfaces)

**Key technique:** Compare **pre-event vs post-event** delta for reliability - reduces false positives

**Synergy:** Pair S1 (flood extent through clouds) with S2 (vegetation damage assessment when clear)
:::

#### Sentinel-1 Pre-Processing "Under the Hood"

::: {.callout-note}
## P0 Improvement: Understanding Analysis-Ready SAR Data

For Day 3 flood mapping labs, we provide **pre-processed Sentinel-1 patches**. Here's what has been applied:
:::

**Standard S1 GRD Processing Pipeline:**

1. **GRD Download** → Raw ground-range detected amplitude
2. **Radiometric Calibration** → Convert to backscatter coefficient (σ⁰)
3. **Terrain Correction (RTC)** → Remove topographic distortions using DEM (critical in mountainous Philippines)
4. **Speckle Filtering** → Reduce SAR noise (Lee, Refined Lee, or Gamma-MAP filters)
5. **Conversion to dB** → γ⁰ (gamma-naught) in decibels for visual interpretation
6. **Tiling/Clipping** → Extract area of interest

**Why this matters:**
- RTC is essential for mountainous areas to remove terrain-induced distortions
- Gamma-naught (γ⁰) in dB is the standard for land applications
- Speckle filtering improves interpretability but can blur edges
- These steps are computationally intensive - we pre-process for training efficiency

**Workflow:**
1. Acquire pre-flood and during-flood Sentinel-1 GRD images
2. Apply pre-processing pipeline above (or use pre-processed patches)
3. Change detection or thresholding
4. Extract flood extent polygon
5. Deliver map within 10-20 minutes of data availability

**Philippine Example:** DOST-ASTI's DATOS Help Desk uses this approach to provide near-real-time flood maps to disaster response agencies using AI-powered automated processing.

**Revolutionary Benefits:**
- Enhanced temporal resolution beyond the standard 5-day revisit
- Improved probability of cloud-free acquisitions
- Better monitoring of rapid changes
- Assessment of three-satellite constellation utility for future missions

::: {.callout-important}
## What This Means for Philippine EO

With three Sentinel-2 satellites operational:

- **More frequent observations** over the Philippines and Southeast Asia
- **Higher chance** of capturing cloud-free imagery during monsoon seasons
- **Better temporal coverage** for crop phenology monitoring
- **Improved** disaster response and damage assessment capabilities
- **Enhanced monitoring** of fast-changing events (typhoon impacts, flooding)

This configuration will be studied throughout 2025 to inform future Copernicus expansion decisions.

::: {.callout-note}
## Red Edge Bands - Sentinel-2's Special Capability

Bands 5, 6, and 7 (the "red edge" region) are particularly sensitive to:
- Chlorophyll content variations
- Early vegetation stress (before visible to human eye)
- Crop health and disease detection
- Subtle changes in forest canopy

This makes Sentinel-2 superior to Landsat for agricultural and forest monitoring applications.
:::

### Data Products

#### Level-1C (Top-of-Atmosphere Reflectance)

**Processing:**
- Radiometric and geometric corrections applied
- Orthorectification using DEM
- Sub-pixel multispectral and multitemporal registration

**Output:**
- Top-of-atmosphere reflectance
- 100 km × 100 km tiles (MGRS grid)
- UTM/WGS84 projection
- Cloud and land/water masks included

**Format:** JPEG2000 (.jp2) in SAFE archive, or GeoTIFF on some platforms

#### Level-2A (Bottom-of-Atmosphere Surface Reflectance)

**Processing:**
- Atmospheric correction using Sen2Cor processor
- Accounts for:
  - Gaseous absorption (O2, H2O, O3)
  - Rayleigh scattering
  - Aerosol scattering and absorption
  - Cirrus correction
  - Terrain effects

**Output Products:**
- **Surface reflectance** for all bands except B10
- **Scene Classification Layer (SCL)** at 20 m:
  - No data, saturated/defective, cloud shadows, vegetation, bare soils, water, cloud (low/medium/high probability), cirrus, snow/ice
- **Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT)** at 60 m
- **Water Vapor (WV)** at 60 m
- **Cloud probability** masks at 60 m
- **Snow probability** masks at 60 m

**Why Level-2A is Recommended:**
- Physically meaningful surface reflectance values
- Directly comparable across dates and seasons
- Built-in quality masks (clouds, shadows, snow)
- **CEOS Analysis Ready Data (ARD) compliant** (Processing Baseline 04.00+)

::: {.callout-tip}
## Always Use Level-2A When Available

For vegetation indices, land cover classification, and change detection:
- Level-2A removes atmospheric effects
- Provides consistent reflectance values
- Includes quality masks (clouds, shadows)
- Ready for analysis without preprocessing

**Exception:** Use Level-1C only when you need to apply custom atmospheric correction or work with very recent data before Level-2A is available.
:::

#### Scene Classification Layer (SCL) - Better Cloud Masking

::: {.callout-important}
## P0 Improvement: Use SCL Instead of QA60

**Why SCL is superior:**
- **QA60** provides only basic cloud/cirrus detection via bitmasks
- **SCL** provides comprehensive 20m classification layer with 12 classes:
  - No data (0), Saturated/defective (1)
  - Cloud shadows (3) - **QA60 misses these!**
  - Vegetation (4), Bare soils/rocks (5), Water (6)
  - Cloud low probability (7), Cloud medium probability (8), Cloud high probability (9)
  - Cirrus (10), Snow/ice (11)

**In Session 4 GEE lab:**
We'll mask pixels where `SCL ∉ {3, 8, 9, 10, 11}` (exclude shadows, clouds, cirrus)

**Optional enhancement:** Apply 1-pixel dilation to remove cloud fringes
:::

**Result:** Cleaner composites with both clouds AND shadows removed - critical for NDVI time series and land cover classification in Day 2.

### Processing Baseline Updates

**Current Baseline: 05.11** (deployed July 23, 2024)
- Supports Sentinel-2C and future 2D specifications
- Implements Product Specification Document (PSD) v15.0

**Important Note:** After January 25, 2022 (Processing Baseline 04.00), Sentinel-2 DN values were shifted by 1000 to accommodate improved radiometric performance.

**Solution:** Use **HARMONIZED** collections in Google Earth Engine that correct for this shift, ensuring consistent values across the entire 2015-present time series.

### Sentinel-2 Band Combinations for Visualization

- Good for general interpretation
- Urban areas, water bodies, vegetation

#### False Color Infrared
**RGB = B8, B4, B3** (NIR, Red, Green)
- Vegetation appears bright red (high NIR reflectance)
- Water appears dark blue/black
- Urban areas appear cyan/gray
- **Excellent for:** Vegetation health, water body delineation

#### SWIR Composite (Agriculture)
**RGB = B11, B8, B2** (SWIR1, NIR, Blue)
- Highlights moisture content
- Agricultural fields appear in various colors based on crop type and water content
- **Excellent for:** Crop differentiation, soil moisture assessment

#### SWIR-NIR-Red (Burn Scar)
**RGB = B12, B8, B4** (SWIR2, NIR, Red)
- Burned areas appear bright red/magenta
- Healthy vegetation appears green
- **Excellent for:** Post-fire assessment, burn severity mapping

#### Bathymetric
**RGB = B4, B3, B1** (Red, Green, Coastal Aerosol)
- Penetrates water for shallow bathymetry
- Coral reefs and seagrass beds visible
- **Excellent for:** Coastal and marine habitat mapping

### Common Spectral Indices

**NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index):**

$$
NDVI = \frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + Red} = \frac{B8 - B4}{B8 + B4}
$$

- **Range:** -1 to +1
- **Interpretation:**
  - < 0: Water, clouds, snow
  - 0 - 0.2: Bare soil, rock, sand
  - 0.2 - 0.4: Sparse vegetation (grassland, shrubs)
  - 0.4 - 0.6: Moderate vegetation (crops, degraded forest)
  - 0.6 - 0.8: Dense vegetation (healthy crops, forest)
  - > 0.8: Very dense vegetation

**EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index):**

$$
EVI = 2.5 \times \frac{B8 - B4}{B8 + 6 \times B4 - 7.5 \times B2 + 1}
$$

- Reduces saturation in dense vegetation
- Better sensitivity in high-biomass areas
- Corrects for atmospheric and soil background effects

**NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index):**

$$
NDWI = \frac{Green - NIR}{Green + NIR} = \frac{B3 - B8}{B3 + B8}
$$

- **High values (>0.3):** Open water
- **Low values:** Land surfaces
- **Use:** Water body mapping, flood detection

**MNDWI (Modified NDWI):**

$$
MNDWI = \frac{Green - SWIR1}{Green + SWIR1} = \frac{B3 - B11}{B3 + B11}
$$

- Better than NDWI for built-up areas
- Suppresses built-up land features

**NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio):**

$$
NBR = \frac{NIR - SWIR2}{NIR + SWIR2} = \frac{B8 - B12}{B8 + B12}
$$

- Pre-fire: High values (healthy vegetation)
- Post-fire: Low values (burned areas)
- **dNBR (differenced NBR):** NBR_pre - NBR_post = burn severity

**SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index):**

$$
SAVI = \frac{(NIR - Red)}{(NIR + Red + L)} \times (1 + L)
$$

where L = 0.5 (general use)

- Reduces soil background effects
- Better for areas with sparse vegetation

**MSI (Moisture Stress Index):**

$$
MSI = \frac{SWIR1}{NIR} = \frac{B11}{B8}
$$

- Indicates vegetation water content
- Higher values = higher water stress

#### Using NAMRIA Data as Training Labels

::: {.callout-tip}
## Micro-Edit: NAMRIA/Space+ as Label Sources & Validation Layers

NAMRIA data is not just context - it's a **critical source of training labels** for machine learning:

**Example Workflow for Day 2 Palawan RF Lab:**
1. Download NAMRIA land cover shapefile (authoritative class labels)
2. Overlay on Sentinel-2 imagery in GEE or QGIS
3. Extract training points per class:
   - Forest (closed canopy, open canopy)
   - Agriculture (crops, plantations)
   - Water bodies
   - Built-up areas
   - Barren land
4. Train Random Forest classifier on Sentinel-2 bands + indices
5. Validate predictions against NAMRIA hold-out samples from different tiles
6. Generate updated land cover map for current date

**Space+ Dashboard** provides:
- Administrative boundaries for stratified sampling
- Infrastructure layers for context in visualizations
- Overlay capabilities for validation

**One Example Visualization:**
NAMRIA training polygons (color-coded by land cover class) overlaid on Sentinel-2 RGB true-color composite - this is what participants will create in Day 2.
:::

**Integration Best Practice:**
Use NAMRIA as **baseline truth** for training, then detect changes with multi-temporal Sentinel data. This combines authoritative national mapping with frequent satellite updates.

**❌ Don't apply a Palawan RF land cover model to Mindanao without re-sampling**
- **Why:** Different climate zones, vegetation types, rainfall seasonality, and soil properties
- **Do:** Collect local training samples from target region (Mindanao) or use transfer learning with local fine-tuning

**❌ Don't use un-calibrated SAR (raw digital numbers)**
- **Why:** Digital numbers are sensor-dependent and meaningless for quantitative analysis or comparison
- **Do:** Always calibrate to σ⁰ (sigma-naught) or γ⁰ (gamma-naught) in decibels

### Processing Assumptions

**❌ Don't skip terrain correction (RTC) for SAR in mountainous areas**
- **Why:** Topographic distortions create false changes; slopes appear brighter/darker regardless of surface properties
- **Do:** Apply Radiometric Terrain Correction (RTC) using SRTM 30m DEM or better (ALOS DEM)

**❌ Don't mix Sentinel-2 processing baselines without harmonization**
- **Why:** DN offset of +1000 after January 25, 2022 (Processing Baseline 04.00) breaks time series analysis
- **Do:** Use **HARMONIZED** collections in Google Earth Engine (`COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED`)

**❌ Don't use QA60 for cloud masking (use SCL instead)**
- **Why:** QA60 misses cloud shadows; leads to "ghost" clouds in composites and contaminated NDVI
- **Do:** Use Scene Classification Layer (SCL) to mask clouds, shadows, and cirrus

### Evaluation & Validation

**❌ Don't train and test on the same geographic tile or province**
- **Why:** Inflated accuracy metrics; model doesn't generalize to new areas
- **Do:** Use **geographic hold-out** - train on tiles from western Luzon, test on eastern Luzon or Visayas

**❌ Don't rely solely on overall accuracy for land cover classification**
- **Why:** Class imbalance (e.g., 90% forest) inflates accuracy; rare classes perform poorly
- **Do:** Report **per-class precision/recall**, **F1-scores**, and **area-weighted accuracy**; use stratified sampling

**❌ Don't assume 10m Sentinel-2 resolution is sufficient for building detection**
- **Why:** Individual buildings are often sub-pixel at 10m; yields poor mAP scores
- **Do:** Frame as "**built-up / settlement extent detection**" or use higher-resolution data for true building footprints

### Data-Centric Best Practices

**✅ Always check:**
- Data provenance (where did training labels come from?)
- Temporal alignment (satellite date matches ground truth collection date?)
- Class balance (are minority classes adequately sampled?)
- Spatial autocorrelation (are train/test points truly independent?)

**✅ Document:**
- Processing steps applied (calibration, filtering, atmospheric correction)
- Training data sources and collection methods
- Known limitations and appropriate use cases
